ninja-form-less-mixins
======================

CSS LESS mixin file for using Bootstrap3 with the Ninja Forms Wordpress plugin

This is the start of a LESS mixin file for Ninja Forms but may not support all form fields just yet.

Usage:
Include ninja-forms.less in a .less file that also imports bootstrap.

example:

    @import "bootstrap/bootstrap.less";
    @import "ninja-forms.less";

In the Ninja Forms fields editor, add normal bootstrap styles to the 'Custom CSS Classes' setting

example:

    form-control col-lg-6

enjoy!
